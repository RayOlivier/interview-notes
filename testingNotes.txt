//as I get more familiar with test driven development, these are things to keep in mind
//these notes are written with jest in mind

-DON'T test constants, third-party libraries, in-line styles, and "Things not related to the tested component"

-Snapshot tests: "a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly"
    >"A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a screenshot, then compares it to a reference image stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two images do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the screenshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component."
    >jest uses .toMatchSnapshot()
